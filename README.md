# Power_Consumption_Choropleth
A Python script to visualize global power consumption using a choropleth map.ü¶ö
This project visualizes global power consumption by country using an interactive choropleth map. It uses Plotly for visualization and pandas for data manipulation.

The plotly.express module is part of Plotly, a popular Python library for creating interactive visualizations. It's a high-level interface designed for ease of use, enabling quick and easy creation of various types of charts with minimal code.üíï

Power_Consumption_Choropleth
Description:
This project visualizes global power consumption by country using an interactive choropleth map. The project utilizes Plotly for data visualization and pandas for data manipulation.
The data used in this project is based on a sample dataset for demonstration purposes. If you are interested in using the actual dataset, feel free to upload your own data or find a suitable dataset for global power consumption or other similar parameters. Make sure the data structure matches the requirements for the choropleth map visualizationüòä

Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

pandas
plotly
You can install them using:
pip install pandas plotly

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas plotly
Output
Once the code runs successfully, it generates an interactive choropleth map showing the power consumption of countries across the globeüëç
